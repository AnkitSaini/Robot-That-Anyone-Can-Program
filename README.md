Robot-That-Anyone-Can-Program
=============================

Robot that can be trained and re-trained by anyone without changing code. 

The project is inspired by the Baxter robot of Rethink Robotics. The code is written for Arduino UNO. 
The robot is trained using an Android phone app. The Arduino is connected to the Android using a
bluetooth shield. 

This was my first project, so the code is not tidy. But I have tried my best to separate the snippets of
codes performing different fuctions.
