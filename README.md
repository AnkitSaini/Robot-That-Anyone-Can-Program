Robot-That-Anyone-Can-Program
=============================

Robot that can be trained and re-trained by anyone without changing code. 

Intrigued about the working of Baxter robot by Rethink Robotics, the code is written for a normal two wheel robot, which can be trained to move on any path between any two points.  The code is written for Arduino UNO. The robot is trained using an Android phone app. The Arduino is connected to the Android using a bluetooth shield. 

This was my first project, so the code is not tidy. But I have tried my best to separate the snippets of codes performing different functions.
